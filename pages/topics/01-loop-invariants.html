            <h2>Understanding Loop Invariants</h2>
            <p>
                Think of a loop invariant as a "truth contract" that helps us understand why our
                algorithm works. It's like a property that remains consistent throughout the loop's
                execution, helping us build confidence in our code's correctness.

                <p>
                    Imagine climbing a staircase while carrying a cup of water. The water staying
                    in the cup is your "invariant" - it must remain true at each step. Just as you
                    check the water hasn't spilled after each step, we verify our loop invariant
                    after each iteration.

                        Think of this as "starting on solid ground." Before we begin looping,
                        we need to make sure our invariant is true. This gives us a strong
                        foundation to build upon.

                    <p class="intuition">
                        This is like maintaining balance while walking - if our invariant is
                        true for one step, we ensure it stays true for the next step. Each
                        iteration preserves our "truth contract."

                        should help prove that we've achieved our goal. It connects what we've
                        maintained to what we wanted to accomplish.

                        consists of the elements originally in A[1..j-1], but in sorted order.

                                Before the first iteration (j=2), A[1] is a single element,
                                which is trivially sorted. Our invariant holds as a starting point.

                                Each iteration takes a new element A[j] and places it in its
                                correct position within A[1..j-1]. After the shift, A[1..j]
                                becomes our new sorted section.
